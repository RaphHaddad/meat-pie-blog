The Meat Pie Blog is a blog dedicated to the search of the perfect meat pie.
While we are currently based in Sydney, Australia. We plan to explore the
country in search of the perfect meat pie.
We may also review the odd sausage roll.

## Methodology

Our methodology is not strict but we will judge meat pies on the following
variables:

1. Price (including whether tomato sauce was free)
1. Crunch Level
1. Taste
1. Meat Chunk Sizes
1. Temperature
1. Messiness Level
