## Comment

The pie in the sky meat pie shop is a popular pie shop just outside of Sydney.
I ordered the original beef pie and I was not disappointed. The pastry in this
pie is what made it, it had a perfect crunch and it was obvious that the pastry
was baked on the day. The meat chunk slices were slightly larger than I would've liked and not as hot as I would've liked (I got to the shop around closing time
that may be why). Nevertheless, the quality of the meat was amazing!

I can see the hype over this pie shop and I'll definitely be going back.
