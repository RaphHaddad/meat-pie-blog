## Crunch Level

Obviously we can't judge a sausage roll's crunch level at the same standard
as a meat pie. But the ends of the sausage roll here was perfect.
It just crunched into my teeth. Leaving a good amount of pastry behind to be
chewed. Excellent!

## Taste

The taste was brilliant! The blend with the nuts was really good. It also
tasted a bit different with and without the tomato sauce. Very good would
recommend.

## Meat Chunk sizes

The chunk sizes were good as well. There was enough space between the
meat and the pastry (a good meat:pastry ratio).

## Temperature

Perfect temperature. Was warm on the outside. But hot on the inside, but not
too hot to burn my tongue (which often happens in poor quality sausage rolls).

## Messiness Level

Not messy at all (you shouldn't expect sausage rolls to be that messy).
However it's good every now and then to have a bit of pastry falling off
as you bite. Would've liked a slight bit more messiness. But it's all good.

## Verdict

I would say that this is an 8/10. The reason I didn't give it a 9, was simply
because of the fact that I had to pay for tomato sauce.
