## Crunch Level

Since I heated this meat pie in the microwave, the crunch level was actually
quite bad. It probably would've been better if I had put it in the oven.
But I was in a rush.

## Taste

The taste was average. I mean it probably would've been better if I
had put in the effort and chucked it in the oven. But these things just happen.

## Temperature

The temperature was OK. The package recommended that I oven bake it, but
the microwave worked!

## Messiness level

The messiness here wasn't your traditional licking-of-fingers but
rather a sloppy messiness. Probably the microwave's fault.

## Verdict

This was a cheap and convenient pie, it was also quite big. I ate two of
these pies, which meant it was good. It's not a gourmet pie but it was still
good for only $1. 6/10!
