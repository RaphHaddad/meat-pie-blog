### Crunch Level

There was absolutely NO crunch in this Meat Pie. In fact it was quite soggy.

### Taste

The pastry taste was pretty poor. However, the meat itself was OK, the chunk sizes where actually quite good.

### Temperature

The temperature was quite good. However, I feel that it was kept hot artificially and that is why the pastry was very soggy.

### Messiness level

The messiness level was quite tame (which is a negative). For a meat pie eaten at the NRL Grand final you would think it would be a slight bit messier.

### Verdict

The pie was expensive, soggy and it wasn't even round (it was oval). Definitely NOT a good pie. 3/10.
