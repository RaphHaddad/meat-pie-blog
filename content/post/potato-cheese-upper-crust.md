## Comment

The Upper Crust is one of the oldest pie shops in the country and
this particular pie didn't disappoint. It was one of the tastiest pies
that we've reviewed here at the meat pie blog, the combination
of potato and cheese balanced with the meat provided a unique experience.
Unfortunately though, it had very little crunch and it wasn't messy enough
(we like our meat pies to have a little mess,
it's part of the experience). Highly recommended!
