## Crunch Level

Considering the pie itself was called the 'crunchy' steak pie. I would've
assumed that there would be a bit more crunch. I mean it wasn't soggy, but
didn't have that extra hit of crunch I was expecting.

## Taste

The taste was a bit above average. I mean it had a good mix of gravy and meat
chunks. I thought it was on par. Nothing special though.

## Meat Chunk sizes

This is where this pie shines. I mean the meat chunk sizes where perfect.
Not too big, not too small.

## Temperature

The temperature was also good, the meat pie was nice and hot, but not too hot.

## Messiness Level

The messiness level was perfect, it wasn't too messy and not too neat.
I got a bit of gravy on my thumbs when I was eating. But licking it off was
perfect. Because it wasn't too hot, when the meat fell on my thumbs it didn't
burn me. I was able to lick the meat of my hands with ease.

## Verdict

I would say this meat pie is a good 6.5/10. It tasted good, although you could
probably find pies with this quality for much cheaper.
