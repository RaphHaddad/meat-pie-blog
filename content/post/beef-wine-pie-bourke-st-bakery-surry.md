## Comment

Bourke Street bakery in Surry Hills is a favorite of the Meat Pie blog and
this pie didn't disappoint. It was a tasty pie with a near perfect crunch
level. The taste, however, didn't match the description, so it lost half a
star there (didn't really taste wine).  
  
I found too much inconsistency with the meat chunk sizes. Although a bit of
variety is good. This pie had some chunks that were about 4cm long and some
that were almost minced.  
  
In summary, a good pie that I would recommend.
