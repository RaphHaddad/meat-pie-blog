## Comment

So I was just going back home and decided that I needed a sausage roll.
I saw this little place near Town Hall and decided to give it a shot.
When I asked for the sausage roll the lady gave me it in a bag. I then asked
'do you have sauce'. She said 'sorry no sauce but I can put it on top for you'.
So naturally I said 'yes' and was thinking to myself 'this is great,
free sauce IN THE CITY'. Next thing you know, she opens the bag and
just squirts sauce inside the bag (not on the sausage roll)!!!!  
  
The sausage roll itself is below average. The meat chunks were too stuck
together for a sausage roll and the taste was horrible. Surprisingly
though the meat to pastry ratio was fine.
