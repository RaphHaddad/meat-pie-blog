## Comment

This pie was a tasty break from the usual beef pies I usually get. It was very
tasty and I appreciate the mix of scallops and salmon chunks in the pie.
However, the temperature was too hot, when the curry dropped on my fingers
it burnt them. Be sure to taste a scallop and salmon curry pie when
you're next in Tassie!
