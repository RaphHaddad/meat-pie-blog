## Comment

After a ski trip I thought I'd pop by the famous Bredbo Pie shop. It's a
wonderful shop in regional NSW that not only sells pies, but other products like
honey and chocolate as well. Highly recommended.

The lamb and mushroom pie was a delight to eat. Good chunk sizes for both the
mushrooms and meat and the ratio of meat and mushrooms was close to perfect.

However, I found that it wasn't messy enough, I like my pies to have a degree of
messiness to them and that's why I gave the messiness level a 2/5. It seems that
this is correlated to the meat to pastry ratio where there was too much pastry
to hold the meat and it was not breaking.
