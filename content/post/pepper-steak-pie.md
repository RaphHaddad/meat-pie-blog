## Crunch Level

The crunch on this one was a beauty. Especially on the top of the pie where the
two pieces of pastry close in together.

## Taste

The taste here was a bit below average. The pie said it was a pepper and steak
pie. However, I couldn't not taste any of the pepper.

## Meat Chunk sizes

The meat chunk sizes were rather inconsistent. Some chunks were big, some were
small and some of the meat was minced. Also, the spread of these types of meat
chunks were inconsistent around the pie itself.

## Temperature

The temperature here was fine. It was your typical convenient store
temperature where they had kept the pies under strong light heating for
a while.

## Messiness Level

It should've been messier. I mean I ate this pie so quickly and it barely
caused me any grief.

## Verdict

At first, I said I would give this pie a 6/10. Mainly because the taste wasn't
to the level that I expected it. But because the tomato sauce was free, and
the crunch level was good. I will give it a 7/10.
