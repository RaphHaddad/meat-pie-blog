## Comment

Harry’s Café de Wheels is an iconic Australian culinary establishment that
began with a humble pie cart operating from Woolloomooloo, NSW set up
by Harry “Tiger” Edwards all the way back in 1937. It has now grown into a
chain with multiple locations around NSW.

I ordered their famous “Tiger Pie” named for the founder which is
essentially just your standard beef meat pie topped with generous layers of
mashed potato and mushy peas with a well of gravy in the middle. These
extra layers on top beautifully complimented the top quality beef meat pie
below (I tend to mix the layers of gravy, peas, potato and pie filling). The
meat chunk slices were large but well in proportion with the size of the pie
and the quality of the beef was very good. The pie was hot and fresh to eat
and the mild spiciness of the pie filling added a welcome further addition to
what you’d normally expect from a beef pie.

All in all, Harry’s Newcastle didn’t fail their time tested reputation as makers
of top quality pies and as usual the heaped pies and peas on top made for
a tasty variation of what we’ve normally come to expect from a pie.
Thoroughly recommended.
